                            I created this website with two main goals in mind: to showcase my different skills/experiences 
                            and to expand my knowledge on front-end languages, design, and development. I learned everything I needed to know 
                            through documentation and resources like google and stack overflow. I will continue to update this website 
                            as I complete new projects and gain more experience.

                            During the summer of 2022, I wanted to expand my knowledge on machine learning algorithms and applications and I was able to accomplish this via the 
                            creation of a simple anime recommendation system that relied on item-based collaborative filtering to provide myself with anime recommendations 
                            on the basis of information collected from other users with similar preferences. This filter used two datasets, the first being my MAL dataset which contains 
                            all the anime I have watched and their respective rating and the second dataset is from Kaggle and contains information on user preference data from 
                            73,516 users on 12,294 anime. Under the hood, this filter identified the users with preference most similar to mine and used this to estimate potential ratings 
                            for anime I am yet to watch. Using these predicted ratings, the system would then finally output the top anime I am most likely to enjoy.

                            This side project was also an extension of a machine learning algorithm that I implemented during the summer of 2022. This recommendation system relies on 
                            content-based filtering which uses movie features to recommend other similar movies that the user may like. In this case, the system takes the 
                            user's favorite movie from 2006-2016 and the number of recommendations they'd like as input and then uses a cosine similarity hueristic to find the n 
                            movies that are most similar to the user's favorite movie. This system relies on an IMDB dataset that contains information on the 1000 most popular movies 
                            from 2006-2016.
